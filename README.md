# Autofocus Tool

Focus stacking is a technique used in many industries to
combine multiple images with out-of-focus areas into a
combined image such that it maximizes the in-focus areas
to create the sharpest composition possible. Focus stacking
algorithms generally take in a number of photos focused at
different distances outputting an aggregate image that
attempts to include the sharpest points in each image in the
stack.
